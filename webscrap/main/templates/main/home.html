<h1>Hello, there!</h1>
<p>I have observed that users currently lack the ability to request ChatGPT to explore a website, absorb its contents, and deliver a comprehensive report. This limitation can prove to be quite frustrating, considering the immense capabilities of ChatGPT and the substantial length of information that a website can contain. Consequently, I have taken it upon myself to create this web application to jump through this loop</p>
<p>My intention for this website is to keep extending ChatGPT capability </p>
